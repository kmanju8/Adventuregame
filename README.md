# Adventuregame
A simple(???) text rpg for NodeJS

For first day, a bit of trouble sorting out project so we used LiveShare for a bit, hence the fewer commits in the first day.
Main elements of game were created, such that game could be extended with more time.

Had issues running function in 'multichoice.js' in main program loop, probably due to asynchronicity, but were unable to fix in time. This function takes trivia questions from an open API and was meant to be a 'battle system'. This can be tested by running the function from 'multichoice.js', it was just not integrated successfully.
